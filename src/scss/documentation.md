# Sass Documentation
This is the description file used for Sassdoc which documents your Sass programming. Add any additional information about your Sass styleguide or your preferred convention to this file and make sure to make your developers aware of the link to the documentation. The link can be set up in the `Gruntconfig.yml` file, by default its `/documentation`.
