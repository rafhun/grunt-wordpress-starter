This folder contains partials with your utilities. Make sure to prefix all utility classes with `u-` to make your markup more readable.

Organize utilities in partials, then import them in `style.scss`.

Make sure to keep utilities as terse as possible. Organizationally they should never be more then an atom, but do one thing, and do it well.
