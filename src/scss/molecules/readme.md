Molecules consist of one or more nested rules, but each of them is not more than an atom. For example, using icons or buttons in molecules is valid, but using other molecules is not.
In other terminologies this structure might be called component.

Add your molecules in partials to this folder, than reference the partial in your `style.scss` file to make sure, the partial is imported.
