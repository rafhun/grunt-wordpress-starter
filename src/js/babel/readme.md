# Babel Compilation

All files you put in here are run through babel with the es2015 preset, meaning in this directory you are able to use ES6 code without having to think about cross browser compatibility since this preset turns your ES6 code into valid ES5 code.

If you need more/different compilations, you can always add or change the presets used by simply editing the `.babelrc` file (do not forget to also install the new preset you want to be using through npm).
