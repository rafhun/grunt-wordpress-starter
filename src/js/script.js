// Use this file if you are sure you will never use es6 features in this project as it does not get compiled through babel. For concatenation the es6 file gets put before the script.js file. However it is recommended to make your choice at the beginning of the project and go with just one file. This makes things easier and clearer. Delete the file you do not intend to use.
