        Atoms are the very basic elements of the stylesheet. Imagine every single-class element or selector rules as an atom. Examples could be buttons, links, headlines, inputs ... you get it, right?
      .SG-p.
        To mark an element as an atom, annotate it with the <span class="SG-strong">@atom</span> tag, followed by the name of the component. Special atoms are <span class="SG-strong">@icons</span>.
